Sir/Maâ€™am,
<br>
<br>
My name is ABHISHEK.H.S. I was born and brought up in Shimoga and I am presently 
based out of same location.

My highest degree is a full time BE / B.Tech in Information science from Malnad College of Engineering, Hassan  that will complete in Jul-2022. My GPA out of 10 is 7
My Information science degree(s) is giving a range of skills  that I feel are crucial for my career and life. Despite limited exposure, I have understood that hard work 
and determination can make anything possible. I am ready to do that. Also, I am trying to develop a habit of reading current trends and industry news.

I interned with Tequed labs for 1 Month(s) in total and contributed to the Web development. My project work(s) lasted for 1 Month(s) in total as I worked on Online Complaint
 Management System. I would like to add that I am certified in 1 Month(s) DS.

When it comes to schooling, I secured 75.0% in my XIIth Karnataka Senior Secondary examination in 2018 in English medium. In Xth Karnataka Board, I got 82.4%. During my
 schooling, I developed strong communication skills and also had the opportunity to participate and excel in several extracurricular activities. Because of these exposures 
 and experiences during my academic years, I have gradually been able to develop effective communication skills. So, I can interact freely within a team.

To add, I am also skilled in C, Java, HTML, CSS, MySQL and PHP. I can read, write and speak in Kannada .

Lastly, I am a quick learner and believe in learning from my past mistakes. This is a virtue as it can take me ahead in both my professional and personal life.

<br>

<br>
One of my biggest strength is that I am a team player. It is a skill that I picked up in school as a member of Sports team. I enjoy working in teams and have been
 often told by both supervisors and peers that I am the motivator of the group during stressful situations. In college, during a group presentation, one of the team 
 members did not submit his bit of work. Given the short deadline, everybody was worried. Analyzing the situation, I called for a short meeting. I asked everyone to
  take equal parts of the unfinished business and we managed to hand in a great presentation. My biggest weakness is that at times, my communication style can be blunt and harsh. Hence, I am learning to reserve my judgment and write down my blunt criticism before I say it aloud. This has allowed me to communicate well and build strong professional relationships.
